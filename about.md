The Basics
==========

I'm currently a Mechanical Engineering student studying at Curtin University
in Western Australia. Although I'm studying Engineering, I don't mind getting
my hands dirty with computers every now and then. In this day and age,
technology is a fact of life, and the ability to use computers and make them do
what you want is often one of the greatest advantages someone can have.

A good example of having the ability to make computers do your bidding is
something that happened to me a while ago. A friend approached me asking if it
was possible to go scrape a certain website and download all the testing data
that they publish for students to use. Manually downloading hundreds of
compressed CSV files and traversing the entire website would have been nigh on
impossible, but after less than 3 hours of coding I built a web scraper from
scratch to do the job. I just needed to hit go and then go make a cup of
coffee, letting the scraper download almost 4 GB of tyre testing data.

That's just one example of how knowing a little bit about coding and the
internet can potentially save you days of manual labor.

Some of My Better Work
----------------------
* A web scraper to scrape the entire Tire Testing Consortium forum and download
  all the testing data for the Curtin Motorsport Team 
  ([GitHub repository][ttc-scraper]).
* A super useful web server I designed using Python and the [Flask][flask] web 
  framework to sit on my Raspberry Pi and give me details about the Pi, 
  similar to the Windows Task Manager, just by navigating to the Pi's IP 
  address in a browser ([GitHub repository][statis-server]). 
* Another web scraper, this time to traverse the Curtin Blackboard system and
  download the lectures, tutorials, labs and other documents relevant to each
  of a student's units ([GitHub repository][blackboard-scraper]).
