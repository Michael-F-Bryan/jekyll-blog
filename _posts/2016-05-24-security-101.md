I thought I'd make a post to help remind myself of some of the important things
to do when securing a new computer, I'll try to explain some of the reasoning
behind some of it as well. For both your benefit and mine.

What Do We Need?
================

Instead of starting off installing random programs and configuring them, it's
better to list some of the things we'll need first. So what will we need to do?

Accounts and Passwords
:    Sounds like a pretty basic thing, yet 9 times out of 10 the reason you get
     hacked probably won't be because of some obscure software vulnerability,
     but because you left the root account's password as "password" or "root".

Firewall
:    For blocking off all ports (and therefore services) from being accessible
     from the wider internet, with the exception of a chosen few. (e.g. ssh and
     http)

Fail2Ban
:    To make it harder for people to crack your passwords by brute-forcing ssh.
